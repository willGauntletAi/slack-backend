I'm making a slack clone. For database design, see: {@dingllmIncludeFile /Users/wilbertfeldman/Documents/gauntlet/slack/slack-backend/src/db/types.ts}
I'm trying to determine what endpoints I need. Can you give me an initial list?

Here's a basic list of endpoints you'll likely need:

Users:
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/register
- GET /users/me
- PUT /users/me

Workspaces:
- POST /workspaces
- GET /workspaces
- GET /workspaces/:id
- PUT /workspaces/:id
- GET /workspaces/:id/members
- POST /workspaces/:id/members

Channels:
- POST /workspaces/:id/channels
- GET /workspaces/:id/channels
- GET /channels/:id
- PUT /channels/:id
- GET /channels/:id/members
- POST /channels/:id/members

Messages:
- POST /channels/:id/messages
- GET /channels/:id/messages
- PUT /messages/:id
- DELETE /messages/:id
- POST /messages/:id/reactions

Direct Messages:
- POST /dm
- GET /dm/:channelId/messages
- PUT /dm/:messageId

Need anything specific about any of these?
